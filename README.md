# PFSE - Privacy Focused CLI Based Search Engine

PFSE (Privacy Focused CLI Based Search Engine) is a command-line tool that allows you to perform searches on popular search engines like Google and DuckDuckGo while maintaining your privacy. It ensures that your identity (IP) remains hidden from the search engines, providing you with a more secure and private search experience.

## Features

- Privacy: PFSE ensures that your IP address is not exposed to the search engines while performing searches.
- Multiple Search Engines: Currently, PFSE supports Google and DuckDuckGo, with more search engines planned to be added in the future.
- No Proxy or VPN Required: Unlike other privacy-focused solutions, PFSE doesn't require you to set up proxies or use VPNs to hide your IP address from the search engines.
- Grabengine: PFSE utilizes an online hosted compiler  to fetch HTML content from the search engines. It generates randomized IP addresses for each request, adding an extra layer of privacy to your searches.
- Beta Version: PFSE is currently in beta, and user feedback is highly encouraged. If you encounter any issues or bugs, please report them on the project's GitHub Issues page.
